**General Air Quality Level:**
The air quality in Delhi is currently classified as Fair, which indicates that the air is relatively clean.

**Health Hazards Associated:**
Although the AQI is Fair, there are still some potential health hazards associated with the pollutants present in the air. Specifically:

* High levels of PM2.5 and PM10 can exacerbate respiratory issues, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* Elevated levels of O3 can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat.
* Moderate levels of NO2 can contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, which can also cause respiratory issues.

**Recommended Precautions:**

* Wear a mask rated N95 or N100 when outdoors, especially during peak pollution hours (7 am - 11 am and 4 pm - 7 pm).
* Avoid strenuous outdoor activities, especially for those with pre-existing respiratory conditions.
* Keep windows and doors closed, especially during peak pollution hours, to reduce indoor pollutant exposure.
* Use air purifiers in homes, especially for those with respiratory conditions.

**Specific Guidance for Sensitive Groups:**

* **Children:** Avoid outdoor play during peak pollution hours. Encourage children to wear masks when outdoors and limit their time spent in areas with high pollution levels.
* **Elderly:** Take extra precautions to avoid outdoor activities during peak pollution hours. Use air purifiers and keep windows and doors closed to reduce indoor pollutant exposure.
* **Those with Asthma:** Monitor air quality closely and take necessary precautions. Wear a mask rated N95 or N100 when outdoors, and avoid strenuous outdoor activities. Use air purifiers and keep windows and doors closed to reduce indoor pollutant exposure.
